## üöÄ About The Project

Notes-App is a comprehensive solution designed to help users, especially students, keep track of their tasks and deadlines efficiently. The application provides a clean, intuitive user interface with both a Kanban board for workflow visualization and a calendar for a clear overview of upcoming deadlines.

A standout feature is its integration with Google Firestore for real-time data synchronization and a Telegram bot for automated deadline reminders, ensuring you never miss an important task.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your system:
* Python 3.8+ and Pip
* A Google Account to create a Firebase project.
* A Telegram Account to create a bot.

### Installation & Configuration

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git)
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY
    ```

2.  **Set Up Google Firebase**
    * Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
    * In your project, enable the **Firestore Database**.
    * Navigate to *Project settings* > *Service accounts*.
    * Click on **"Generate new private key"**. A JSON file will be downloaded.
    * Rename this file to `firebase-credentials.json` and place it in the root directory of the project.

3.  **Set Up Telegram Bot**
    * Open Telegram and search for the `@BotFather`.
    * Send the `/newbot` command and follow the prompts to create your bot.
    * BotFather will provide you with an **API Token**. Copy this token.
    * Find your personal **Telegram User ID** by talking to a bot like `@userinfobot`.

4.  **Create the Local Settings File**
    * In the project's root directory, create a new file named `settings.json`.
    * Copy the structure below into the file and fill it with your own credentials from the previous step.
    ```json
    {
        "telegram_token": "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_HERE",
        "telegram_id": "YOUR_PERSONAL_TELEGRAM_USER_ID_HERE"
    }
    ```

5.  **Install Python Dependencies**
    * It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv .venv
    
    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On Windows:
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    # source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
    * Install all required libraries from `requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Once all the dependencies are installed and the configuration is complete, run the main application script:

```bash
python note_app.py
